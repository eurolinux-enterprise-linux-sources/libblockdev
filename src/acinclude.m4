dnl LIBBLOCKDEV_SOFT_FAILURE(MESSAGE)
dnl
dnl Store a message that in some contexts could be considered indicative
dnl of a failure, but in other contexts could be indicative of who cares.
dnl
dnl Any message sent to this macro will be stored, and they can all be
dnl displayed at the end of configure using the LIBBLOCKDEV_FAILURES macro.

dnl LIBBLOCKDEV_PKG_CHECK_MODULES(VARIABLE-PREFIX, MODULES)
dnl
dnl Check whether a module is available, using pkg-config. Instead of failing
dnl if a module is not found, store the failure in a message that can be
dnl printed using the LIBBLOCKDEV_FAILURES macro.
dnl
dnl The syntax and behavior of VARIABLE-PREFIX and MODULES is the same as for
dnl PKG_CHECK_MODULES.

dnl file that just includes the HEADER using the given CFLAGS. In case of
dnl failure, the ERR_MSG will be printed using the LIBBLOCKDEV_FAILURES macro.
